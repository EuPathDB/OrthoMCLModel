                   Find Ortholog Groups by the average percent homology of proteins in the group. Importantly, homology only applies to core proteins in a 'Core' group and peripheral proteins in a 'Residual' group, because only these proteins are used in the OrthoMCL algorithm to define groups. (Peripheral proteins that map to a Core Group are not assigned homology, and thus are not included in this search.) For example, consider a Core group containing 5 core proteins. A protein in this group has 75% homology if it is a Ortholog, CoOrtholog or Inparalog of 3 of the 4 other proteins, as assigned by the OrthoMCL algorithm. The average percent equals each protein's % homology divided by the number of proteins in the group.

<p>Find Ortholog Groups by phyletic pattern.</p>

<p>A Phyletic Pattern Expression (PPE) is a powerful way to search for Ortholog Groups by the species they contain. The pattern specifies groups with the presence or absence of one or more sets of species, and optionally the number of sequences in each set of species.</p>

<p><b>Examples</b></p>
These expressions find ortholog groups in which...
<table>
    <tr><th><code>hsap>=5</code></th><td>there are five or more human sequences</td></tr>
    <tr><th><code>hsap+ecol=2T</code></th><td>both human and E. coli are present.</td></tr>
    <tr><th><code>hsap+ecol=1T</code></th><td>only one species of human or E. coli is present.</td></tr>
    <tr><th><code>hsap+ecol>=1T</code></th><td>only one or both species of human and E. coli is present.</td></tr>
    <tr><th><code>hsap+ecol>=10</code></th><td>there are 10 or more human or E. Coli sequences.</td></tr>
    <tr><th><code>EUKA=5</code></th><td>there are exactly eukaryotic 5 sequences</td></tr>
    <tr><th><code>EUKA=5T</code></th><td>there are exactly eukaryotic 5 taxa</td></tr>
    <tr><th><code>hsap+FIRM=2T</code></th><td>there are exactly 2 human or Gram-positive bacteria taxa</td></tr>
    <tr><th><code>EUKA=35T</code></th><td>there are all 35 eukaryotic species, ie, Eukaryota-universal groups</td></tr>
    <tr><th><code>EUKA>=5T AND hsap>=10</code></th><td>there are at least five eukaryotic species and containing at least 10 human sequences.</td></tr>
    <tr><th><code>(EUKA>=5T AND hsap>=10) OR pfal<20</code></th><td>there are at least five eukaryotic species and containing at least 10 human sequences, or there are less than 20 P. falciparum sequences.</td></tr>
    <tr><th><code>ALL=150T</code></th><td>there are all 150 OrthoMCL species.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b>Tips</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> Avoid redundancy in your PPE. For example, <code>hsap>=1</code> is equal to <code>hsap=1T</code>, so no need to mention them twice.</li>
  <li> Merge different PPE units for faster execution.  For example <code>hsap=1T AND mmus=1T</code> can be merged as <code>hsap+mmus=2T</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The PPE Grammar in Detail</b></p>
<p>Individual grammatical units of PPE expressions are composed of two parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li> <b>A taxa specification.</b>  This can be any one of:
    <ul>
    <li>a species abbreviation (e.g. <code>tgon</code>)</li>
    <li>a clade abbreviation (e.g., <code>BACT</code> for all Eubacteria taxa)</li>
    <li>a list of species or clade abbreviations linked by plus sign "+" (e.g. <code>tgon+pfal+hsap+FIRM</code>). </li>
    <li><code>ALL</code> to represent all taxa in OrthoMCL.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> <b>A logical comparison operator followed by a count.</b> 
    <ul>
    <li>operators allowed are: <code>></code>, <code><</code>, <code>=</code>, <code>>=</code>, and <code><=</code></li>
    <li>the count is either:
      <ul>
      <li>a number, such as <code>5</code>.  This is a count of <i>sequences</i> that the operator applies to.</li>
      <li>a number with a <code>T</code>, such as <code>5T</code>.  This is a count of <i>taxa</i> that the operator applies to.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Multiple expression units may be combined using <code>AND</code> or <code>OR</code>, and may use parentheses to provide explicit execution ordering.</p>
